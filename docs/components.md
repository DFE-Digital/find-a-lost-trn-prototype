The rig incorporates [GOV.UK Prototype Components](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/), a selection of common components not currently in the GOV.UK Design System:

* [Autocomplete](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/autocomplete/)

* [Masthead](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/masthead/)

* [Related navigation](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/related-navigation/)

* [Summary card](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/summary-card/)

* [Task list](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-prototype-components/task-list/)

While these may already be in use across different services, they should be considered experimental until research has validated their design and their accessibility has been audited.
