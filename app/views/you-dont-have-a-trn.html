<!-- ## How to get a TRN

If you’re eligible for a TRN in England, you should be allocated one automatically by the Teaching Regulation Agency or Capita Teachers’ Pensions.

If you do not have a TRN but need one to do a national professional qualification (NPQ), you should get instructions about how to request one. If you do not receive these instructions, email qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk. -->

## What a TRN is for

You need a TRN to:

* [access your teaching qualifications](https://access-your-teaching-qualifications.education.gov.uk/qualifications/sign-in) to download your certificates, change the name on them or check details of your initial teacher training and induction
* give to employers so they can complete mandatory teacher status checks
* manage records of your contributions to the Teachers’ Pensions scheme
* give to the Department for Education (DfE) when you have been awarded QTS so you can begin your early career teacher induction
* be a [mentor for a trainee or early career teacher](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn#if-youre-a-mentor-for-a-trainee-or-early-career-teacher)
* [register for an NPQ](https://register-national-professional-qualifications.education.gov.uk/registration_closed)

    You only need a TRN if one of the above applies to you. You will not get one for any other reason.
