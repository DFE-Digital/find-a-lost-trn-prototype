## What a teacher reference number (TRN) is for

You need a TRN to:

* view your record with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), and download professional certificates in the [Teacher self service portal](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login?_ga=2.206960218.899524735.1637088337-1609244267.1609598427)
* give to employers so they can complete mandatory teacher status checks
* manage records of your contributions to the Teachers’ Pensions scheme
* give to the Department for Education (DfE) when you have been awarded QTS so you can begin your early career teacher induction
* register for a national professional qualification (NPQ)

## Get a TRN to register for an NPQ

You do not need to be a teacher to get a TRN.
