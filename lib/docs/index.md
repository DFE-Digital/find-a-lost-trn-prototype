description: All you need to prototype anything from simple static pages to complex, data-driven transactions.

The Prototype Rig is a minimal and opinionated version of the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs). It is designed to be used by developers familiar with the Nunjucks template language.

It drops support for legacy frameworks and undocumented features, and updates the underlying tooling. It also includes Nunjucks helpers that are useful when creating pages and flows.
